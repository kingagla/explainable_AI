# Explanaible AI

In this project I compare how model explainability changes if data are biased.
I consider 2 datasets (biased and unbiased) -  the biased dataset is created by filtering the unbiased.

Similar accuracy can suggest that models work similarly but following analysis of possibility to explain them shows that they differ a lot. In features importance analysis we can see that biased one often use sex as one of most important variables.
